## Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset ##

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing sentiments from tweets related to a specific topic using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods.

**Features**
* Preprocessing and cleaning of raw Twitter data.
* Implementation of feature extraction techniques.
* Machine learning model training for sentiment classification.
* Model evaluation and performance metrics analysis.

**Installation**

To replicate this project, you will need Python 3.8+ and a set of dependencies, which you can install via: pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a requirements.txt file listing your dependencies, such as:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk

**Usage**

1. **Data Preparation:** Place your Twitter dataset in the data/ directory.
   
2. **Running the Notebook:** Open the sentiment_analysis_twitter_dataset.ipynb and follow the steps outlined.
   
3. **Model Training:** Execute the cells to preprocess data, extract features, train models, and evaluate results.

**Methods and Techniques Used**

* **Data Cleaning:** 
        - Remove URLs, hashtags, and mentions
        - Convert text to lowercase
        - Handling missing values
        - Remove punctuation and special characters
        - Tokenization
        - Remove stopwords
        - Stemming etc.

* **Feature Extraction:** Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Count Vectors.
  
* **Models Used:**
        MultinomialNB
        Decision Tree
        Random Forest Classifier
        Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
  
**Results**

Achieved an 85% accuracy for sentiment classification using Logistic Regression, which performed competitively against the Random Forest model.

**Future Work**

Explore deep learning approaches such as LSTM and transformers for sentiment analysis.

Integrate more advanced NLP techniques for feature engineering.
